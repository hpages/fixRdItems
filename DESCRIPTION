Title: Fix '\item' tags with empty labels in .Rd files
Description: A simple utility to fix '\item' tags with empty labels
	in .Rd files. '\item' tags with empty labels are sometimes found
	in '\\describe' sections, and they typically have the following
	form: \item{}{\code{...}: ...}
	Starting with R 4.3, they are no longer considered valid, and
	they trigger an 'R CMD check' warning. The utility provided in
	this package fixes this by replacing them with alternative form:
	\item{\code{...}:}{ ...}.
	IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not use this on the .Rd files generated by
	roxygen2!
