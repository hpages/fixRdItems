A simple utility to fix `\item` tags with empty labels in `.Rd` files.

`\item` tags with empty labels are sometimes found in `\describe`
sections, and they typically have the following form:

    \item{}{\code{...}: ...}}

Unfortunately, starting with R 4.3, they are no longer considered
valid, and they trigger an `R CMD check` warning.

The `fix_items_in_rdfiles()` function provided in **fixRdItems** fixes
this by replacing them with alternative form:

    \item{\code{...}:}{ ...}

IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not use this on the `.Rd` files generated by **roxygen2**!
